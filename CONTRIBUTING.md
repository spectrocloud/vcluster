## Contributing to vcluster

Thank you for contributing to vcluster! Here you can find common questions around developing vcluster.

### How can I get involved?

There are a number of areas where contributions can be accepted:

- Write Golang code for the vcluster syncer, proxy or other components
- Write examples
- Review pull requests
- Test out new features or work-in-progress
- Get involved in design reviews and technical proof-of-concepts (PoCs)
- Help release and package vcluster including the helm chart, compose files, `kubectl` YAML, marketplaces and stores
- Manage, triage and research Issues and Pull Requests
- Engage with the growing community by providing technical support on GitHub
- Create docs, guides and write blogs

This is just a short list of ideas, if you have other ideas for contributing please make a suggestion.

### Setup vcluster for Development

We recommend to develop vcluster directly in a Kubernetes cluster as it makes feedback a lot quicker. For the quick setup, you'll need to install [devspace](https://github.com/spectrocloud/devspace#1-install-devspace), docker, kubectl, helm and make sure you have a local Kubernetes cluster (such as Docker Desktop, minikube, KinD or similar) installed.

Fork and clone the repo:
- Click Fork button (top right) to establish a cloud-based fork.
- git clone your-fork-url

After cloning make sure the variable `SERVICE_CIDR` in the `devspace.yaml` fits your local clusters service cidr. You can find out the service cidr with:

```
kubectl create -f ./hack/wrong-cluster-ip-service.yaml 
The Service "service-simple-service" is invalid: spec.clusterIPs: Invalid value: []string{"1.1.1.1"}: failed to allocated ip:1.1.1.1 with error:provided IP is not in the valid range. The range of valid IPs is 10.96.0.0/12
```

In this case the service cidr would be `10.96.0.0/12`. Please make also sure you use an adequate `K3S_IMAGE` version that matches your local cluster version.

After adjusting the variables and you can run:

```
devspace run dev
```

Which should produce an output similar to:

```

[0:sync] Waiting for pods...
[0:sync] Starting sync...
[0:sync] Sync started on /Users/fabiankramm/Programmieren/go-workspace/src/github.com/spectrocloud/vcluster <-> . (Pod: vcluster/vcluster-0)
[0:sync] Waiting for initial sync to complete
[info]   Opening shell to pod:container vcluster-0:syncer
root@vcluster-0:/vcluster#
```

Then you can start vcluster with
```
go run -mod vendor cmd/vcluster/main.go start
```

Now if you change a file locally, DevSpace will automatically sync the file into the container and you just have to rerun `go run -mod vendor cmd/vcluster/main.go start` within the terminal to apply the changes.

You can access the vcluster by running `devspace enter` in a separate terminal:

```
devspace enter -n vcluster

? Which pod do you want to open the terminal for? vcluster-0:syncer
[info]   Opening shell to pod:container vcluster-0:syncer
root@vcluster-0:/vcluster# kubectl get ns
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   2m18s
kube-system       Active   2m18s
kube-public       Active   2m18s
kube-node-lease   Active   2m18s
root@vcluster-0:/vcluster#
```

`kubectl` within the syncer container will point to the virtual cluster and you can access it from there. If you need to recreate the vcluster, delete the `vcluster` namespace and rerun `devspace run dev` again. 

#### Debug vcluster with Delve
If you wish to run vcluster in the debug mode with delve, run `devspace run dev` and wait until you see the command prompt (`root@vcluster-0:/vcluster#`).  
Run `dlv debug ./cmd/vcluster/main.go --listen=0.0.0.0:2345 --api-version=2 --output /tmp/__debug_bin --headless --build-flags="-mod=vendor" -- --lease-duration=99999`  
Wait until the `API server listening at: [::]:2345` message appears.  
Start the `Debug vcluster (localhost:2346)` configuration in VSCode to connect your debugger session.  
If you are not using VSCode, configure your IDE to connect to `localhost:2346` for the "remote" delve debugging.  
**Note:** vcluster won't start until you connect with the debugger.  
**Note:** vcluster will be stopped once you detach your debugger session.  

### Running vcluster Tests

You can run the unit test suite with `./hack/test.sh` which should execute all the vcluster tests.  

The e2e test suite can be run from the e2e folder(`cd e2e`) with this command - `go test -v -ginkgo.v`.  
Alternatively, if you [install ginkgo binary](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo#global-installation), you can run it with `ginkgo -v`.

For running conformance tests, please take a look at [conformance tests](https://github.com/spectrocloud/vcluster/tree/main/conformance/v1.21)
