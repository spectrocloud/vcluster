title: Synced Resources
sidebar_label: Synced Resources
---

This section lists all resources that can be synced or mirrored by vcluster currently in the table below. Those resources can be activated or deactivated via the `values.yaml` as described below, or with the `--sync` flag of the syncer. By default, certain resources are already activated and you can either disable the default resources or tell vcluster to sync other supported resources as well.

| serviceaccounts        | Syncs created service accounts from virtual cluster to host cluster. This is useful for using [IAM roles for service accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) with vcluster                                                         | No              |

By default, vcluster runs with a minimal set of RBAC permissions to allow execution in restricted environments. Certain resources require extra permissions, which will be automatically given to the vcluster ServiceAccount if you enable the resource sync with the associated helm value.

## Enable or disable synced resources

To enable a resource syncronization, for example persistent volumes, and automatically create the necessary RBAC permissions, add the following to your `values.yaml`:
```
sync:
  persistentvolumes:
    enabled: true
```
then create or upgrade the vcluster with:

```
vcluster create my-vcluster -n my-vcluster-namespace --upgrade -f values.yaml
```

To disable a resource that is synced by default, for example if you don't want to sync ingresses, set the following in your `values.yaml`: 
```
sync:
  ingresses:
    enabled: false
```
then create or upgrade the vcluster with:

```
vcluster create my-vcluster -n my-vcluster-namespace --upgrade -f values.yaml
```

:::warning Correct Cluster Functionality
Disabling certain resources such as services, endpoints or pods can lead to a non-functional virtual Kubernetes cluster, so be careful with what resources you are deactivating. 
::: 

## Sync other resources

Syncing other resources such as deployments, statefulsets and namespaces is usually not needed as those just control lower level resources and since those lower level resources are synced the cluster can function correctly. 

However, there might be cases though were custom syncing of resources might be needed or beneficial. In order to accomplish this, vcluster provides an [SDK](https://github.com/spectrocloud/vcluster-sdk) to develop your own resource syncers as plugins. To find out more, please take a look at the [plugins documenation](../plugins/overview.mdx).
